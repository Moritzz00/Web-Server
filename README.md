# Local Server that counts how often you visit a website

A simple server that counts the total views of the website and displays it using HTML and Javascript. It also keeps a histogramm of the browsers that were used.

To test it, pull repository and run "python server.py" on the command line. You can then visit the site on: http://localhost:8000/

I suggest reloading the page to see the value change.
